Worth.ies app

Worthies is a web application in which each user gets a recommendation for a movie or a show. The user signs in with his account and hits the button to get a recommendation on what to watch or play. His recommendations are stored in his watchlist, where the date of the pick is provided.
Furthermore, user can select the rating and genre of a movie, and get random picks based on those preferences. All these recommendations are randomly picked to his preferences.
This application is also responsive.
